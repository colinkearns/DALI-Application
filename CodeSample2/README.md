## Colin Kearns - Climate Data Analysis of Newark, NJ

In this file, I analyze 70 years of climate data sourced from the Newark, NJ airport for significant climate change trends. I took an excel file, which I modified in excel to work with and visualize in python. 

I mainly worked with extreme temperature, average temperature, and precipitation data to Analyze significant trends. I found that overall warming trends in Spring, Summer, and Winter showed significance, as well as some precipitation and extreme heat metrics.

I found that some trends did not show significance over the whole 70- year period, but became significant in the past 50 years, so I tested certain metics for that change.

Overall, I found that Newark has experienced significant trends in climate change, and visualized them above.
